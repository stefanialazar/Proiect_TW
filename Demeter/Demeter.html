            <h3 class="h3">FACTS</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li class="fact">Demeter was the daughter of Cronos and Rhea.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was the goddess of harvest and fertility.</li>
                <li class="fact">She had one daughter, Persephone; Zeus was Persephone’s father.</li>
                <li class="fact">After Hades abducted Persephone, Demeter grieved. The earth became barren through her neglect; thus, the winter season and its manifestations were a reflection of Demeter’s emotional state during Persephone’s absence.</li>
                <li class="fact">She revealed to man the art of growing and using corn.</li>
                <li class="fact">Only women attended the Thesmophoria, a fertility festival held in honor of Demeter.</li>
                <li class="fact">The fields of grain and the threshing-floor were under her protection. They were temples at which she could occupy at any moment.</li>
                <li class="fact">Her chief festival came at the harvest time. It began as a humble feast and over time morphed into a mysterious worship. This great festival occurred only every five years.</li>
                <li class="fact">Demeter and Dionysus were worshipped at Eleusis, a little town near Athens. Their worship was referred to as the Eleusinian Mysteries.</li>
                <li class="fact">Demeter was older than Dionysus. They were the two great gods of THE EARTH.</li>
                <li class="fact">Metaneira, a mother herself, comforted Demeter in Persephone’s absence. In fact, Demeter nursed one of Metaneira’s children. She doted on the child and anointed him with ambrosia on a daily basis. Demeter’s attachment to the child alarmed
                    Metaneira, and the two ultimately went their separate ways.</li>
                <li class="fact">Still angry over the abduction of Persephone, Demeter subjected the world to famine. Zeus sent the gods to Demeter one by one to try and bring her out of her despondency. Demeter and Persephone were ultimately reunited at Zeus’s decree.</li>
                <li class="fact">Demeter was granted four months per year with Persephone; her daughter would remain with Hades for the remaining months.</li>
                <li class="fact">Men called Demeter the “Good Goddess” despite the desolation she had brought about as a result of her grief.</li>
                <li class="fact">She named Triptolemus her ambassador to men.</li>
                <li class="fact">She taught Triptolemus and Celeus her sacred rites.</li>
                <li class="fact">In ancient art, Demeter was pictured wearing a wreath made of ears of corn.</li>
                <li class="fact">The snake and the pig were sacred to her.</li>
                <li class="fact">The torch is often depicted in connection with Demeter because of her persistent search for Persephone.</li>
                <li class="fact">Demeter came to Eleusis during the reign of King Erechtheus of Athens.</li>
