            <h3 class="h3">ABOUT</h3>
            <p class="p">Worshipped by basically everybody, Aphrodite, “the One who rises from the sea” was appropriately called Pandemos, “of all the people.” However, she was also called Ourania or “heavenly,” so some Greek moralists tried to make a distinction
                between these two Aphrodites, claiming that Aphrodite Pandemos is the goddess of sexual desire and Aphrodite Ourania, the one of “platonic love.” </p>
            <p class="p">Now we know that this was the same goddess, called by numerous other contradictory epithets as well, which often describe the complex nature of love: “smile-loving,” “merciful,” and the “One who postpones old age,” but also “unholy,” “the
                dark one,” “the killer of men.”</p>
            <p class="p">Homer and Hesiod tell two different stories about the origin of Aphrodite.</p>
            <p class="p">According to the former, Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Diona, thus making her a second-generation goddess, much like the most Olympians.</p>
            <p class="p">However, Hesiod retells the much more famous myth. According to him, Aphrodite was born when Uranus’ genitals fell into the sea after he was castrated by his son Cronus. The goddess of love emerged from the waters on a scallop shell, fully-grown,
                nude, and more beautiful than anything anyone had ever seen before or since.</p>
            <p class="p">Aphrodite was so lovely that only the three virgin goddesses – Artemis, Athena, and Hestia – were immune to her charms and power. Unsurprisingly, the second she got on Olympus, she inadvertently wreaked havoc amongst the other gods, each of
                whom instantly wanted to have her for himself. So as to prevent this, Zeus hurriedly married her to Hephaestus, the ugliest among the Olympians. Of course, this merely alleviated the problem: Aphrodite didn’t plan to remain faithful.</p>
            <p class="p">So, she started an affair with someone as destructive and as violent as herself: Ares. Helios, however, saw them and informed Hephaestus, after which the cuckolded god made sure to devise a fine bronze net, which ensnared the couple the next
                time they lay together in bed. To add insult to injury, Hephaestus called upon all the other gods to laugh at the adulterers and freed them only after Poseidon agreed to pay for their release.</p>

        <div id="name">
            <h3 class="h3">NAME</h3>
            <p class="p">Aphrodite’s name is usually linked to the Ancient Greek word for “sea-foam,” aphros, which fits nicely with the story of her birth. However, modern scholars think that both Aphrodite and her name predate Ancient Greece and that the story actually
                came because of the goddess’ name.</p>

            <h3 class="h3">FACTS</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite was the goddess of fertility, love, and beauty.</li>
                <li class="fact">Two different stories explain the birth of Aphrodite. The first is simple: She was the child of Zeus and Dione.</li>
                <li class="fact">According to the second story, however, Aphrodite rose from the foam of the sea.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, but Aphrodite did not enter into this union of her own volition.</li>
                <li class="fact">She and Ares conceived Harmonia, who eventually married Herodotus.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was the mother of Hermaphroditus by HERMES.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite and her son Eros (Cupid) teamed up to cause Zeus to fall in love with a human named Europa.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite loved Adonis. She saw him when he was born and determined then that he should be hers. She assigned Persephone to his care, but Persephone fell in love with Adonis also and would not give him back. Finally, Zeus had to mediate.
                    He judged that Adonis should spend half the year with each.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite used a swan-drawn car to glide easily through the air.</li>
                <li class="fact">Although Aphrodite and Hera were not friends, HERA went to the Goddess of Love for help as she endeavored to assist the heroes in their Quest of the Golden Fleece.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite, Hera, and ATHENA were the top three contenders for a gold apple marked “For the Fairest.” They asked Zeus to judge the contest, but he refused. Paris, son of the King of Troy, judged the contest instead. Each of the three goddesses
                    promised him something in return; he chose Aphrodite as the winner of the apple. This story of the Judgment of Paris was considered to be the real reason behind the Trojan War.</li>
                <li class="fact">During the Trojan War, Aphrodite fought on the side of Paris.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite rescued Paris from Menelaus by enveloping him in a cloud and taking him back to Troy.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite owned a girdle that contained her enchantments; Hera borrowed it once to seduce Zeus in order to distract him from the Trojan War.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite gave Harmonia a necklace that brought disaster to a later generation.</li>
                <li class="fact">Prostitutes considered the Goddess of Love their patron.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite had a few mortal lovers. One of the most notable was the Trojan shepherd Anchises. The two of them conceived Aeneas.</li>
                <li class="fact">Corinth was the center of Aphrodite’s worship.</li>
                <li class="fact">Early Greek art depicted the goddess as nude.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was the model for the famous sculpture Venus de Milo.</li>
                <li class="fact">Aphrodite and Cupid initiated the love between Jason (hero of the Quest of the Golden Fleece) and the daughter of the Colchian King.</li>
