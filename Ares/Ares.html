            <ul class="bullet">
                <li class="fact">Ares was most notably referred to as the God of War; he represented the unpleasant aspects of battle.</li>
                <li class="fact">He was the son of Zeus and Hera, both of whom hated him (according to Homer).</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares was most often characterized as a coward in spite of his connection to war; he responded to even the slightest injury with outrage.</li>
                <li class="fact">According to some sources, Ares was described as Aphrodite’s lover and was held in contempt by her husband, Hephaestus. The affair between them was not a secret among the Olympians.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares was never very popular—either with men or the other immortals. As a result, his worship in Greece was not substantial or widespread.</li>
                <li class="fact">He came from Thrace, home of a fierce people in the northeast of Greece.</li>
                <li class="fact">His bird was the vulture.</li>
                <li class="fact">The Amazons, warrior women, were his daughters. Their mother was a peace-loving nymph named Harmony.</li>
                <li class="fact">Otus and Ephialtes, twin giants, imprisoned Ares for a lunar year by binding him with chains of brass; he was eventually rescued by Hermes.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares always took the side of Aphrodite in the Trojan War. He fought for Hector (a Trojan) until a Greek warrior pierced him with a spear that was guided by Athena. He then departed the battlefield in order to complain to Zeus about Athena’s
                    violence.
                </li>
                <li class="fact">Harmonia, Goddess of Harmony, was the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite.</li>
                <li class="fact">Eros (more commonly known as Cupid) was also the child of Ares and Aphrodite.</li>
                <li class="fact">Tereus, a son of Ares, was known to have inherited his father’s abhorrent qualities.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares was the biological father of at least three of Hercules’ enemies: Cycnus, Lycaon, and Diomedes.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares had a sister named Eris, who was the Goddess of Discord.</li>
                <li class="fact">Hebe, another sister of his, was the Goddess of Youth.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares rarely figures into mythology stories, but when he does, he usually suffers some form of humiliation.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares was associated with two other war deities: Enyalius and Enyo.</li>
                <li class="fact">Ares had many offspring, which is characteristic of nearly all of the notable Greek gods. He conceived more mortal children than divine children.</li>
                <li class="fact">In art, Ares is generally depicted wearing a spear and a helmet.</li>
