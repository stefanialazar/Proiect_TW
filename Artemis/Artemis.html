                <li class="fact">According to one source, Artemis was born a day before Apollo. She then served as a guardian to him, which provided a context for her desire to protect and nurture.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was primarily a virgin huntress, goddess of wildlife and patroness of hunters.</li>
                <li class="fact">The bear was sacred to her.</li>
                <li class="fact">She guarded her virginity carefully. Actaeon and Orion tried to dishonor or rape her, but anyone who threatened her purity met with a violent end.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was an important goddess in the lives of women, especially when it came to marriage and young creatures.</li>
                <li class="fact">When one of her nymphs was seduced by Zeus, Artemis transformed her into a bear and then killed her.</li>
                <li class="fact">She was sometimes associated with the goddess of the moon.</li>
                <li class="fact">Artemis acted out in anger whenever her wishes were disobeyed, especially if anyone transgressed against the animals that were sacred to her.</li>

                <li class="fact">Artemis appealed to Zeus to grant her eternal virginity.</li>
                <li class="fact">Apollo and Artemis teamed up to kill the children of Niobe. Niobe bragged that she had birthed more children than Leto (the mother of Apollo and Artemis). The twins then hunted her children and killed them with their bows and arrows.</li>
                <li class="fact">Artemis was worshipped widely in Greece but only as a secondary deity.</li>
                <li class="fact">A temple built in her honor became one of the “Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.”</li>

                <li class="fact">Homer referred to her as a mistress of wild animals.</li>
                <li class="fact">Artemis spent most of her time roaming the forests with her nymphs. She was described as both hunting animals and protecting them.</li>
                <li class="fact">She armed herself with a bow and arrows made by Hephaestus and Cyclops.</li>
                <li class="fact">In art, Artemis is often accompanied by a stag or hunting dog.</li>
                <li class="fact">She is the protector of chastity and a nurturer of the young.</li>
